# Ian's Portfolio

## Description 
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, experience, projects, and contact information. It includes five sections: Home, Skills, and Experience, Projects, and Contact. 
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, displaying different projects I've worked on and providing an easy way to reach out.

## Sections:
*Home:* An introduction and call to action.
*Skills:* A display of my technical skills with progress bars.
*Experience:* A list of my professional experiences.
*Projects:* Showcasing my work and projects with hoverable cards.
*Contact:* A contact form and social media links to get in touch.

## Technologies Used
*HTML:* Markup language for structuring the web pages.
*CSS:* For styling the page and implementing hover effects, animations, and responsiveness.
*JavaScript:* Used to add interactivity, such as smooth scrolling and toggling the mobile navigation.
*Google Fonts:* For incorporating custom fonts, such as Roboto and Poppins.
