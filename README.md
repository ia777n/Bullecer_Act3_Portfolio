# Ian's Portfolio

## Description 
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, experience, projects, and contact information. It includes five sections: Home, Skills, and Experience, Projects, and Contact. 
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, displaying different projects I've worked on and providing an easy way to reach out.

## Sections:
**Home:** An introduction and call to action.<br>

**Projects:** Showcasing my work and projects with hoverable cards.<br>
**Contact:** A contact form and social media links to get in touch.<br>

## Technologies Used
**HTML:** Markup language for structuring the web pages.<br>
**CSS:** For styling the page and implementing hover effects, animations, and responsiveness.<br>
**JavaScript:** Used to add interactivity, such as smooth scrolling and toggling the mobile navigation.<br>
**Google Fonts:** For incorporating custom fonts, such as Roboto and Poppins.<br>
